# Axiom Verge Randomizer Tracker
Map and item tracker for Axiom Verge's randomizer mode. It uses an SDK built into Axiom Verge to get tracker data and display it in your browser.

[Real Time Tracker SDK Documentation](https://axiom-verge-tracker-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## How to use
1. Start Axiom Verge
2. Go to Randomizer mode options and set "Web Tracker" to "On"
3. Open `tracker.html` in your browser
4. Start the existing or new game in randomizer mode

NOTE: Some information is not updated instantly, so some data may be out of sync. This is a limitation on how Axiom Verge sends the tracker data. Usually collecting and item or entering a different area will cause an update.
